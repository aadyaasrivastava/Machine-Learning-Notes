### Define Machine Learning: 
Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without straightforward programming.  Instead of writing out every instruction, machines can improve at a specific task by analyzing data. This data can be used to predict future values, classify information, or find hidden patterns within the data.

#### Types of Machine Learning
Majorly there are two categories of machine learning: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. 
These categories are determined by the type of data and the learning objective.
* **Supervised Learning**: Supervised learning, also called supervised machine learning, is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It involves using labeled data sets to train algorithms to accurately classify data or predict outcomes. This means each data point has a corresponding label or target value that the model is trying to predict. The model learns the relationship between the features (inputs) and the target variables (labels) during training. Then, it can use this learned relationship to predict the target variable for new, unseen data points. 
    * Common supervised learning tasks include classification (e.g., spam detection, image recognition) and regression (e.g., weather forecasting, stock price prediction).

* **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning involves ML algorithms to analyze and group unlabeled data sets, finding hidden patterns without human intervention. Its capability to identify similarities and differences in data makes it useful for various tasks like data analysis, cross-selling, customer segmentation, and image recognition. The model does not have any predefined labels or target values. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find hidden patterns or structures within the data itself. These patterns can be used for tasks like anomaly detection, customer segmentation, or dimensionality reduction.
    * Common unsupervised learning tasks include clustering (e.g., grouping similar data points together) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., reducing the number of features without losing important information).
